# NZNetballAPI
An API for ANZ Premier league netball statistics, players and teams.
To be later used in another project.

Will be web scraping from anzpremiership.co.nz for team and player stats.
Will be using node.js as a back-end.
To be honest dont know much about it but maybe will try make a web app out of it
and use node.js to direct to it?

Plan:
Create web scraper to get data from websites, save to json file for now
Then create a web app api to fetch this data and return it
